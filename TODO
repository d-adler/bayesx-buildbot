- sol: use gmake not make for R builds (workaround... make symlink to gmake in /usr/r-sun64/bin)
- sol: nproc not found (bayesxsrc R build fails - does not compile.. nproc shell dummy in /usr/bin )
- win,osx: add pdflatex
- win: Remove OpenSSH from User vagrant's PATH via script (temporarly deactivated via renaming to ..\OpenSSH_OFF\.. )
       mingw32-make complains: sh.exe is in PATH

DONE: 
- win: added mingw, builds with GSL successfully
- deb: build jar etc..

  - add mingw
  - compile with mingw
    - CMake -G MinGW Makefiles: 
  - disable synced folder

- fed: more minimal R setup for fed ?!
- add vagrant machines: osx
